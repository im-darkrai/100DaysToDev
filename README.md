# 100DaysToDev
"100daystoDev is a personal commitment to grow as a developer by building something every day for 100 days. Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode movement but tailored more broadly, this challenge includes:

🛠️ Daily coding challenges and mini-projects

🧠 Learning logs and reflections

💻 Focus on real-world development tools and workflows

📈 Documenting progress for growth and accountability

Whether you're a beginner aiming for your first job, or a self-taught developer looking to sharpen your skills, this repo captures the daily practice that leads to long-term improvement."


Motivation
The best way to grow as a developer is to build consistently. 100daystoDev is about showing up daily, not just consuming content, but applying what you learn.

"You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."
